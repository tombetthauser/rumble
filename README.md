Rumble is a Bumble dating app clone re-tooled to help retired professional wrestlers find eachother for friendship and the occaisionally friendly wrestling match.

Rumble was built in February of 2020 by Josh Graham, John Enriquez, Garon Hock and Tom Betthauser using a MERN stack. The project's MVP functionality and UI were completed in 8 days. It's design and user experience stick very close to the actual Bumble but takes it's own direction in several areas.

<!-- ### User Profile Edits -->

<!-- ![Spaceport Screen](https://github.com/johnenriquez/spacebrite/blob/master/app/assets/images/app-screens/spaceport-wide.png)

You can view upcoming flights to and from a specific spaceport, regardless of whether you've logged in. Spaceports have their own IATA code, the planet (or celestial body) of their location, and their locality upon that planet. Visiting a spaceport page reveals the inbound and outbound flights scheduled to or from that spaceport.

Flights have their own identification numbers. They all belong to specfic spaceline companies and have a model designation. -->
