Rumble is a Bumble dating app clone re-tooled to help retired professional wrestlers find eachother for friendship and the occaisionally friendly wrestling match.

Rumble was built in February of 2020 by Josh Graham, John Enriquez, Garon Hock and Tom Betthauser using a MERN stack. The project's MVP functionality and UI were completed in 8 days. It's design and user experience stick very close to the actual Bumble but takes it's own direction in several areas.
